CASE :
HR professionals generally lag behind in terms of analytical and data visualization competency. Carla Patalano set out to create their own set of HR-related data, which was used in one of the graduate MSHRM courses called HR Metrics and Analytics, at the New England College of Business. He created this data set. We will use the data set to analyze the data and create some prediction models.

In this project, I carried out EDA on the target to find out how many feature variables were related to the termination of an employee's employment, including the most reasons, based on department, based on gender, etc. Then I created data visualization according to EDA Steps with 5 visualizations. I did Machine Learning modeling to predict employee layoffs.
